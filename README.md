# ctf_walkthroughs
This repository contains all the ctf walkthroughs I have worked on. 

The first walkthrough is the pwnlab based "Enovise Challenge 2" writeup I did in 2017 as a basis of hiring pentesters at Enovise where I worked then.
Greetz to @Zahir for his impressive reporting format. Successive CTF reports carry this format. 

Happy CTF-ing!
